# Wheelchair Accessibility Prediction

## Explanation
Here, you will find my analysis and machine learning model I made as part of the Professional Data Scientist certification by DataCamp. The task was to conduct analysis and create a machine learning model that predicts whether an event is accessible by wheelchair. Afterwards, I had to give a 10-minute presentation on the results in a single take. The whole case study had to be done within 72 hours from when the problem has been viewed.

The problem stated that ideally 2/3 of the events predicted to be wheelchair inaccessbile should indeed be wheelchair inaccessible.

The recording was done using DataCamp's recording software (of which I unfortunatelly could not find nor download)

## What I made

* An XGBoost model and tuned it using scikit-learn as well as graphically from its logloss.
* Data visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib libraries
* Detailed analysis and reasoning using markdowns
* A PPT presentation 

## Access
* Please download the "event_venues.csv" file. You may need to change the directory written on the first cell (pd.read_csv())
* Ensure that all libraries in the file has already been installed (pandas, xgboost, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
