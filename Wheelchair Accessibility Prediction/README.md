# Wheelchair Accessibility Prediction

Here, you will find my analysis and machine learning model I made as part of the Professional Data Scientist certification by DataCamp. The task was to conduct analysis and create a machine learning model that predicts whether an event is accessible by wheelchair. Afterwards, I had to give a 10-minute presentation on the results. The whole case study had to be done within 72 hours from when you viewed the problem at hand.

The problem stated that ideally 2/3 of the events predicted to be wheelchair inaccessbile should indeed be wheelchair inaccessible.

# What I made:

* An XGBoost model and tuned it using scikit-learn as well as graphically from its logloss.
* Data visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib libraries
* Detailed analysis and reasoning using markdowns 

# Access: 
* Please download the "events.csv" file, you may need to change the directory written on the first cell (pd.read_csv())
* Ensure that all libraries in the file has already been installed (pandas, xgboost, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
