# Wheelchair Accessibility Prediction

Here, you will find my analysis and model I made as part of the Professional Data Scientist certification by DataCamp. The task was to conduct analysis and create a machine learning model that predicts whether an event is accessible by wheelchair. Afterwards, I had to give a 10-minute presentation on the results.
